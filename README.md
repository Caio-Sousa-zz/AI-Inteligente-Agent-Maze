# AI-Inteligente-Agent-Maze

# Goal

A practical way to show the general concepts and definitions of an intelligent agent. Project simulates an agent should react in decision-making situations.


# Project Description

There is a maze from where an IA (Intelligent Agent) will go until you find the exit. 

For this the IA will:
* Have a steering sensor for decision making when necessary.

The problem is to develop an agent program capable of "learning" the path out of the labyrinth, given the conditions of navigability and dangerous situations (monsters) of it.

# Methodology

The goal is to map the automaton of the labyrinth, taking into account the following criteria:

1. Each state of the machine will depict the crossover point of the maze. It is at this point that the IA should make a decision based on in the direction sensor it has.

2. In decision-making, in order to choose one of the paths to be taken, the IA should start with N (North) and keep the choice clockwise, if the initial choice fails. The IA should repeat the process until find a valid direction.
